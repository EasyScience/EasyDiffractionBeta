This is a test version of EasyDiffraction with improved GUI and overall performance. This version temporarily does not use the EasyScience framework, contains only CrysPy as calculation engine and uses only Lmfit for minimization.  

### New Features

- Fitting time-of-flight (TOF) data using the [CrysPy](https://github.com/ikibalin/cryspy) calculation engine is now supported.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed visibility of structure viewer on macOS.
