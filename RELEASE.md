This is a test version of EasyDiffraction with improved GUI and overall performance. This version temporarily does not use the EasyScience framework, contains only CrysPy as calculation engine and uses only Lmfit for minimization.  

### Bug Fixes

- The correct x-axis title is now displayed for graphs with TOF data
- The startup splash screen now appears before the calculation libraries are loaded
